==Font2: Jura=

* Family: Jura
* License: OFL (SIL Open Font License)
* Category: Sans-serif
* Description: Jura is a family of sans-serif fonts in the Eurostile vein. It was originally inspired by some work I was doing for the FreeFont project in designing a Kayah Li range for FreeMono. (Kayah Li is a language used by a minority people group in Burma. Because the Burmese government suppresses the teaching of minority scripts, the Kayah Li script is taught only in schools in refugee camps in Thailand.) I wanted to create a Roman alphabet using the same kinds of strokes and curves as the Kayah Li glyphs, and thus Jura was born. It has been expanded to include glyphs for the Cyrillic and Greek alphabets as well. The original Kayah Li glyphs have been included in this font. (Note that glyphs for writing mainstream Burmese are not and never have been a part of this font.) This font is released under the SIL Open Font License; the glyphs in the Kayah Li range are released under a dual license of the OFL and the GNU Public Library, version 3, with the Font Exception.
